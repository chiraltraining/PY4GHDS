# Python for Geospatial Health Data Science (PY4GHDS)
The Python for Geospatial Health Data Science (PY4GHDS) course is designed to provide an introduction to using Python for analyzing and visualizing geospatial health data. The course covers the basics of Python programming, geospatial data processing, and statistical analysis of health data.


Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to work with real-world health and geospatial data to build their skills in Python programming and data analysis. By the end of the course, students will be able to use Python to perform geospatial analysis and statistical analysis of health data, and to communicate their findings through data visualization.


## Why Geospatial Health Data Science 

* Geospatial health data science is an important field because it allows us to better understand the spatial distribution of health outcomes and the factors that contribute to them. By analyzing health data in combination with geospatial data, we can identify patterns and trends that would be difficult to detect using traditional statistical methods.

* Geospatial health data science has numerous applications, such as identifying areas of high disease incidence or prevalence, tracking the spread of infectious diseases, and evaluating the impact of environmental exposures on health outcomes. This information can be used to inform public health policies and interventions, as well as to guide resource allocation and target interventions to those who need them most.

* Python is a powerful and widely used programming language that is well-suited for data analysis and visualization. By learning to use Python for geospatial health data science, students will be able to apply these skills to a wide range of health and environmental datasets, allowing them to contribute to this important field and make meaningful contributions to public health.
